## HTML, CSS and JavaScript Code
You are given the following HTML and CSS and your page should look like the screenshots in the given resources. The workshop goal is to show how to integrate different jQuery plugins into a project.
 
You can use the skeleton and upgrade it with **jQuery plugins** of your choice. Here is what we suggest.

##	Slider Plugin 
**Sliders** allow users to make selections from a range of values - so it is the perfect way to show our open courses. Sliders reflect a range of values along a bar, from which users may select a single value. There are many options to use a slider - you can write it by yourself or you can use plugins.
For the slider section you can use [Slick Slider](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/). See how to integrate it in your project in the [Usage](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) section. 
 
## DateTimePicker Plugin 
The DateTimePicker plugin handles both date and time. For the [Time] input filed in the form you can use the following plugin: https://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/
*Note:* Use the inline version with the white theme and modify it if it's needed.
 
##	Add some functionality
You can add some validations in your form like the following:
*	**Username validation:** A valid username starts with a letter and can only contain letters, digits and underscores “_”. It cannot be less than 3 or more than 25 symbols long.
*	**Lecturer validation:** Should be one of the lecturers’ names.
*	You should not be able to send the form **without** filling all the input fields.
 

After you’ve successfully filled the form, a meeting should be created and displayed in the **[Consultations]** section in the following format: 
```
"{lecturerName} – {date} – {hour}"
```
With each added consultation, **increase** the **total consultations count**.
 
###	Petals falling animation
The winter is coming fading away and the snowflakes are gone. Spring is coming, which is why we will implement falling petals as an animation to our page. The falling petals are a symbol of Autumn, when petals fall, but let’s not put too much thought into that.
You can use the following plugin: https://www.jqueryscript.net/animation/jQuery-Plugin-For-Sakura-Petals-Falling-Animation-Sakura.html
 
###	Notifications
[Notify.js](https://notifyjs.jpillora.com/) is a jQuery plugin which provides simple, yet fully customizable, notification functionality.
